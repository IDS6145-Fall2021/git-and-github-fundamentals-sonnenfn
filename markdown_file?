I'm still pretty confused, but I don't know quite enough yet to be able to articulate what I'm confused about. I'll try though.
- The role of GitHub Desktop and whether I should download it.
- Pushing, and whether or not I actually pushed something
- Committing changes made on desktop in Notepad or whatever, on cloned files.
- What you mean by Markdown file, when Markdown appears related to syntax more than a specific file type.
- How to do a pull request, although I'm going to try that in a minute.
     - Yeah, no, all trying to submit a new pull request did was send me back to the Code tab with an option to compare changes, but nowhere to submit anything. Confused.
